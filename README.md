Milestone Project 1

For my Milestone Project 1 , I have created a website for a 60's band.

My scope on this breif was to first draw up an Idea and an immage of a 60's rock band.  60's rock bands were brightly coloured long hair extroverts.
The band I was creating this website for MileStone Rocks  " Mile marker, Stoned and rockband).
I first created a drawing which I converted into the band Logo.  Whic I created into a poster with performance dates.  
Logo can be found in the images section

The Website needed to have a wow factor to draw attention. It needed to draw the dedicated follower and tthe casual browser in.
I created a video first page promoting the bands upcomming tour, with immagery of the band on stage.

The idea was to excite the viewer then lead them on into the website propper
The web site was conseptualised to lead down through the bands history, Music albums, tour dates, contact information and comment section.
The brief also stated that there should be a way for the band to sell their cd's and merchandise.  For that purpose I created a merchandise page with band t-shirts and jackets with the band logo printed on them.


UX

A typical viewer of the web site would be looking for the following.

    Information on the Band
    List of upcomming gigs
    where to buy tickets
    where to buy cd's
    where to buy merchandice
    Look for past and present music and lyrics
    music lovers looking for inspirational music
    Just browsing. 


The Launch page was created to be a moving video exploding on your screen with links to the home page, merchandise page and the option to download the free band poster with tour dates.

The Home section is set out with information on the Band. Band members profiles.  then downwards to provide a visual of the album covers as well as drop down song words. Contact information as well as band photgraphs.

The Merchandise page was designed according to the brief so as to provide a portal for the sale of band merchandise.  To support theis I designed t-shirts in various coulers adding the band logo to them.  I also designed a typical 
leather jacket with band logo on the back.
